//git init (at server level)
//npm install <name of dependency>  (install dependencies to package.json)
//npm update when changes are made

Why package.json?
  //info relevant to the project
  //info given to NPM for it to identify and interact with the project
  //list dependencies

//add node_modules/ to .gitignore

//make an express server - app.json
